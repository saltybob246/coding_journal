        <p><strong>Daily Log</strong></p>
        This is where I log my daily grind. Studies, insights and lessons learned. 
        
        <p><em><h4>May 7 2025</h4></em></p>

            <p><u><em>What I learned today</em></u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Git commits are local (push only when ready)</li>
                <li>Atomic commits = meaningful chunks of change</li>
                <li>Ctrl+` opens the terminal in VS Code is ðŸ”¥</li>
                <li>Commit messages tell the story of my code</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em><u>Commands Used</u></em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>'git add .'</li>
                <li>'git commit'-because writting messages in VS Code is just better</li>
                <li>'git push origin main'</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em><u>Reflection</u></em></p>
            Thought Git was scary, turns out it's just a smart save button with receipts. Learned alot about proper work flow and how to think about when a commit is a good idea. 
            <ol>
                <li>After finishing a task or feature</li>
                <li>After fixing a bug or layout issue</li>
                <li>After setting up a new page or section</li>
                <li>Before switching to someting unrelated. (e.g., done with nav bar-> now working on image styling)</li>

                

            </ol>
            <u>Commit rules of thumb</u>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't over commit:</strong> <em>No need to commit every 2 minutes</em></li>
                <li><strong>Don't Under commit:</strong> <em>Don't make 25 changes and then commit. Hard to roll back or review</em></li>
                <li><strong>Think Checkpoints, not perfection:</strong> <em>"Would I want to come back to here is something breaks?"</em></li>
            </ul>
            </details>
