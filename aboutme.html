        <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
        Hey, I am Trevor Holmes—a husband, father of two, and a self-taught developer-in-training working through The Odin Project.
        <p>This site is my coding journal: part portfolio, part sandbox, part progress log. I use it to document what I am learning, 
            build projects, and track my growth as I move from HTML and CSS into JavaScript and beyond.</p>

        Why am I doing this? Simple—I am tired of the ad-stuffed, data-hungry mess that makes up most of what is out there for kids today. 
        I want to build better things—apps and tools that actually teach, inspire, or just don't suck the soul out of you.
        So here I am, learning the craft one line of code at a time. Thanks for stopping by.
