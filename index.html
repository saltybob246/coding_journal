        <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. This page serves as my personal coding journal—a space where I document my progress, 
            practice key concepts, and showcase the skills I’m building as I work through The Odin Project.</p>
            Right now, things are looking a little minimal—I've just wrapped up the HTML portion of the Foundations course. 
            As I continue learning and adding new tools to my belt (like CSS, JavaScript, and beyond), 
            this site will evolve along with me.
            Feel free to take a look around and watch it grow.
